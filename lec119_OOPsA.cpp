//Object is an entity that has two things associated with it, its state/property and behaviour. 
/*
we want the project to have 0bjects and it works with objects so that the program can be more related to real world. 
why we need to be more near the real world?: so that its readibility, manageability and extensibility increases.
therefore, oops is the prgram in which the program revolves around the object.
